# RpgCharactersCsharp
A Console game made using C# and Spectre Console

Play in command prompt with console fully filling the screen for best experience

## NOTE

Game is not completly finished yet. All the neccesary logic is in place. 

I just need to create events/encounters for each tile on the island and an ending boss tile (just some kinda of final goal for the player).
I created a simple system with JSON files to make this process faster so i might be done with this very soon

## Installation

```
dotnet add package xUnit
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
dotnet add package Spectre.Console
```
